# multithreading_test

It is always a good approach to do heavy work in the background while users enjoy the main thread. Using Isolates  you can improve your flutter app performance and user experience.

Isolate is basically Thread/Multithreading in dart.

Two Ways to Implement Threading
i.. Use of Compute Function
ii. Use of Isolate.spwan() method.

Both ways are implemented in app , while compute method is currently commented. 



After Threading the Network performance is significantly improved while there might be slightly to negligable issue in memory management.
